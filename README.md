# Color Game
### Overview
This is a basic game that shows an rgb value and allows the user to guess which one of the colored squares on the page match the given rgb value. There are two difficulty settings, easy and hard. On easy, 3 squares are there to choose from; hard has 6. This game is a great tool to get better at learning rgb values to speed up styling based on color. This game is a project from the Colt Steele Udemy bootcamp however the code is refactored from the original course and extensively more commented and explained.
